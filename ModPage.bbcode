Features: (Note: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13434]Pumping Iron[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32579]Sandow Plus Plus[/url], and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74606]Simple Weight Gain[/url] do not simultaneously possess these characteristics)
· [b]No sleep dependency[/b]
Real-time body changes occur immediately with level progression. However, when combined with the "requires sleep for level-up" MCM setting in [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41891]Survival Control Panel[/url], it can replicate the "wake up to bodily development" effect seen in sleep-dependent weight change mods too.

· [b]Weight change based on player level rather than specific skills' level[/b]
As is well known, weight changes in Skyrim don't necessarily reflect muscle growth alone—they can represent other physical features (e.g., breast or dick size) depending on your Bodyslide preset and imagination. They shouldn't be tied solely to combat skills if you want this change to reflect overall strength. For example:

Eyre11 (original concept creator) used [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117278]Daedra Seducers Redux[/url] to create a custom succubus-like race. He implemented a "stronger overall power = larger breasts" mechanic for this character. Combined with a Bodyslide which make breasts get larger with weight growth and the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132720?tab=description]Sex Grants Experience[/url] mod, this achieved the effect where absorbing more victims increases the succubus' level and correspondingly enlarges the player's breasts. Why implement this? Let's just say... personal preferences.
